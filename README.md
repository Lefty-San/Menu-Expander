Menu-Expander
=============

I wanted to make a nice menu with transitions and css selectors without using libraries.
So here it is. All javascript and, CSS, and DOM element node attributes.
I will be the first to admit that I am actually use way more words in the code than needed
but the whole point was to do this the long way; ehhh a long-er way.
